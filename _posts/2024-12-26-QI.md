The proof of Choi-Kraus theorem and understanding
------

This post originates from the assignment of the course "Introduction to Quantum Information", where a state damping form of the quantum system and reservoir is given.

$$\ket{0}\ket{e_0}\rightarrow\ket{0}\ket{e_0}$$

$$\ket{1}\ket{e_o}\rightarrow\sqrt{q}\ket{0}\ket{e_1}+\sqrt{1-p}\ket{1}\ket{e_0}$$

Using partial trace we can convert it into the density matrix form. 

$$Tr_e(\ket{after}\bra{after})$$

$$\begin{bmatrix}
 p_{00}+pp_{11}&\sqrt{1-p}p_{01}\\
 \sqrt{1-p}p_{10}&(1-p)p_{11}
 \end{bmatrix}$$
 
But from this form, how should we derive the Kraus operator is a question.

This leads to the Choi-Kraus Theorem
